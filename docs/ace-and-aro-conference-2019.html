<H1>Ace & Aro Conference 2019 – Aces NYC</H1>
		
		<img src="2019-conference/Ace-Aro-Conference-750x417.png" alt="" class="center">
	
    <p>We are so excited to host a conference during 2019 World Pride for the asexual and aromantic spectrum communities and this year it’s sponsored by WorldPride Pride NYC!</p>

    <p>We have been working hard to create events that will share the work being done in the ace and aro communities, bring people together, and build community. </p>

    <p><strong>When is it?</strong>  Saturday June 29th from 9:00am – 5:00pm</p>
    <p><strong>Where is it?</strong> The Grace Institute at 40 Rector Street, New York, NY 10006</p>
    <p><strong>What is it?</strong> This will be a conference with a few different tracks people can choose from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There will be invited speakers sharing their work, such as authors, researchers, artists, and others. Check out <strong>Who’s Coming?</strong> below.
        </li><li>Space will be reserved for caucus style meetings for those who have different intersectional experiences, rotating between groups throughout the day. For example, a POC Caucus, a Trans/Non-binary Caucus, Aromantic & Allosexual 
        Caucus, and more. </li>
        <li>Un-Conference Style workshops. An un-conference lets attendees shape how they would like to spend their time, removes traditional conference hierarchy, 
        and encourages spontaneous connections. We will take time in the beginning of the day to set an agenda collectively, for a select portion of the conference workshop time slots. 
        </li>
        <li>Interactive workshops such as ones on Fast Friending and creating a Collective Experiences Mural.<br>
       </li>
      </ul>


    <p>Lunch is included in a conference ticket with vegan and gluten free options provided.  Please indicate dietary restrictions on the ticket questionnaire. </p>

	<p><strong>Caucus Spaces</strong></p>
	<p>Caucus spaces are spaces reserved for people who self identify with the group that is meeting. For example, a caucus space for aromantic people would be 
		a space exclusively reserved for aromantic people. The same is true for a space for people of color, or a space for trans and non-binary people.</p>

<h4>Olivia Montoya</h4>
<img src="2019-conference/Olivia%20circle.jpg" alt="" class="center whoscoming">
<p>Olivia Montoya is a 27-year-old (disabled, autistic, chronically ill, latinx, femme, queer-identified) bi/panromantic gray-aromantic (gray) asexual who has participated in asexual 
	communities since 2011 and has identified as asexual to some degree since 
	before even that. Since becoming more open about her asexuality, Olivia has gone out of her way to promote asexual acceptance, representation, and education. Her current 
	primary awareness projects are the Ace Zine Archive, co-founded in 2015, which documents discussions of asexuality in the zine community, and Ace Jam, a month-long online 
	game jam about creating games (digital and analog) with asexual characters that recently ran for its second time. She is deep in the planning stages of editing the first 
	ever asexual comic anthology. She also writes about asexuality and gray-aromanticism in her own zines, edited a free compilation zine on asexuality and relationships 
	titled Asexual Content #1, and makes diverse queer narrative video games with asexual characters.<br></p>
<p><strong>Ace and Aro Zines as Community History and Community Building</strong></p>
	<p>Olivia Montoya</p>
	<p>After years of independent research, Olivia Montoya of the Ace Zine Archive will present some of her discoveries about early explorations of asexuality 
		in zine communities (even predating the online asexual community), how zines can be used to document the changes in ace and aro communities and terminology over time, 
		and current trends in asexual and aromantic zines and their impact. She will also give some basic zines 101, explain how zines can be used for ace and aro education 
		and activism, and provide tools for creating ace and aro zines yourselves. Participants can also contribute to a compilation zine of Ace + Aro Conference experiences, 
		which will be released for free online. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XjPk29R6ow">Find the recording here.</a>
