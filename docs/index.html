                activity, such as going to the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, a picnic in Central Park, museums, etc. Then
                we get together to talk about ace related topics and hang out the third weekend of each month. In
                addition, we help with all Ace related events we can, such as The Ace & Aro Conference for 2019
                WorldPride on the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, and The Ace Un-Conference: AVEN CAKE and work
                to reach out to other groups of aces neighboring cities.</p>
