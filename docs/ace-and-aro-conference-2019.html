<H1>Ace & Aro Conference 2019 – Aces NYC</H1>
    <p>We are so excited to host a conference during 2019 World Pride for the asexual and aromantic spectrum communities and this year it’s sponsored by WorldPride Pride NYC!</p>

    <p>We have been working hard to create events that will share the work being done in the ace and aro communities, bring people together, and build community. </p>

    <p><strong>When is it?</strong>  Saturday June 29th from 9:00am – 5:00pm</p>
    <p><strong>Where is it?</strong> The Grace Institute at 40 Rector Street, New York, NY 10006</p>
    <p><strong>What is it?</strong> This will be a conference with a few different tracks people can choose from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There will be invited speakers sharing their work, such as authors, researchers, artists, and others. Check out <strong>
        <a href="http://www.aces.nyc/whos-coming/">Who’s Coming?</a></strong><a href="http://www.aces.nyc/whos-coming/"> </a>
        </li><li>Space will be reserved for caucus style meetings for those who have different intersectional experiences, rotating between groups throughout the day. For example, a POC Caucus, a Trans/Non-binary Caucus, Aromantic & Allosexual 
        Caucus, and more. </li>
        <li>Un-Conference Style workshops. An un-conference lets attendees shape how they would like to spend their time, removes traditional conference hierarchy, 
        and encourages spontaneous connections. We will take time in the beginning of the day to set an agenda collectively, for a select portion of the conference workshop time slots. 
        </li>
        <li>Interactive workshops such as ones on Fast Friending and creating a Collective Experiences Mural.<br>
       </li>
      </ul>


    <p>Lunch is included in a conference ticket with vegan and gluten free options provided.  Please indicate dietary restrictions on the ticket questionnaire. </p>
