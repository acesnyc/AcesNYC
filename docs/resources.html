            <h4>Activism & Educational Resources</h4>
            <h5>Aces and Aros</h5>
            <p><a href="https://acesandaros.org/" target="_blank">Aces and Aros</a> is a
                hub for the ace and aro community, enabling and encouraging ace and aro people to get involved in their community.

            <h5>Ace Week</h5>
            <p><a href="https://www.aceweek.org/" target="_blank">Ace Week</a>, formerly Asexual Awareness Week, is an 
                international campaign dedicated to raising awareness and expanding education of asexuality. The week gives all of us 
                an opportunity to celebrate how far our community has come and to dream about the future we will create together.
               </p>            
            
            <h5>The Asexual Agenda</h5>
            <p><a href="https://asexualagenda.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">The Asexual Agenda</a>has two primary goals:</p>
            <p>1. Stimulate and promote asexual blogs.  We serve as a community center: a place for readers to discuss with each other, 
                and a portal to other asexual blogs.</p>
            <p>2. Strive towards greater understanding, especially in our target audience: people under the ace spectrum who already 
                understand the basics. Sometimes this means our writers share their expertise, but most often it means we offer our 
                varied perspectives. We are built on the idea that beyond asexuality 101, it is impossible to provide only one single 
                authoritative view of everything. </p>
            <p>The Asexual Agenda does not attempt to be a 101 resource.  If you are learning about asexuality for the first time, 
                you are invited to peruse our <a href="https://asexualagenda.wordpress.com/101-resources/" target="_blank">list of 
                101 resources</a>.  You are also free to stick around and pick it up as you go along.
               </p>   
            
            <h5>Asexuality Archive</h5>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.asexualityarchive.com/" target="_blank">Asexuality Archive</a> is a collection of all things Ace. 
                It hopes to provide a comprehensive and uncensored look into what asexuality is, what it means to us and 
                how it shapes our lives.  The intention is to provide information that is approachable and informative, whether or 
                not you’re asexual.
               </p>

                about asexuality, a bit of 101, as well as links to AVEN’s posts of the week, media, research.

                or somewhere one the ace spectrum can share their personal stories about being asexual, coming out, relationships and any 
                other experiences. Stories are tagged thematically.
